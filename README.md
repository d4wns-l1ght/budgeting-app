# Budgeting Program (name in progress)
A TUI program for managing your personal expenses!

I'm making this because I'm losing access to microsoft excel and I don't want to go back to google sheets.

## Planned Features
- [ ] Nested sheets
    - [ ] Sum of one entire sheet projected to a single cell
    - [ ] Sum of subsequent sections of a sheet projected to a set of subsequent cells
- [ ] In-program file picker (frecency?)
- [ ] Configuration options probably
- [ ] Vim keybinds
